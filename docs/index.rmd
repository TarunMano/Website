## About Me

Hello! My name is Tarun I am a junior at the University of Texas at Austin, with a 
double major in Data Science and Mathematics. I plan to be a data scientist, 
and the use of math to solve problems is something I have always been intrigued by.
In my spare time, I love spending time outdoors, cooking and trying new foods, 
and listening to music.

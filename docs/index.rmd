## Bio

Hello! My name is Tarun I am a junior at the University of Texas at Austin, with a 
double major in Data Science and Mathematics. I plan to be a data scientist, 
and the use of math to solve problems is something I have always been intrigued by, 
hence the career path. In my spare time, I love spending time outdoors, 
cooking and trying new foods, and listening to music.
